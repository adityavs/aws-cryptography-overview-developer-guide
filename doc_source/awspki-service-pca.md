# AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority<a name="awspki-service-pca"></a>

AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority \(ACM PCA\) is a private [certificate authority \(CA\)](pki-concepts.md#concept-ca) service with which you can easily and securely manage your PKI CA infrastructure and your [private certificates](pki-concepts.md#concept-priv-cert)\. ACM PCA provides a highly available private CA service without the investment and maintenance costs of operating your own subordinate CA\. By extending the scope of [AWS Certificate Manager ACM](awspki-service-acm.md) to private certificates, ACM PCA helps you manage both public and private certificates from within one PKI environment\.

You can use ACM PCA to perform a variety of PKI\-related tasks, including the creation of private CAs and the generation, validation, renewal, maintenance, and deletion of private certificates\. For more information about ACM PCA, see the [ACM PCA User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaWelcome.html)\.
